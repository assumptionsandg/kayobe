    Kolla inventories in the kayobe configuration are now passed through as is.
    Previously, only ``group_vars`` were passed through. When using multiple
    environments, the kolla inventory in from the base layer **and** the kolla
    inventory from the environment layer will be passed through. The inventory
    from the environment takes precedence over the inventory from the base
    layer. This allows you to put any shared configuration in the base layer.
upgrade:
  - |
    As kolla inventories are passed through as-is, the inventory directory in
    kayobe config must be a valid Ansible inventory.
  - |
    It is no longer possible to create an environmnet named ``kayobe``. This
    is reserved for internal use.
